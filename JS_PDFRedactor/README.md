# Javascript PDF Redactor

This project was done by three tools. 
	[dropzone](https://github.com/enyo/dropzone) to uploade the PDF file.
	[PDF.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/) to process the PDF file.
	[jsPDF](https://github.com/MrRio/jsPDF) to download the redacted PDF file.

## Usage
	1. You can simply use this tool to redact your PDF file. [Demo](#)
	2. You can use this page as part of your own app to redact pdf file and send to your server.
	3. You can learn something from the tool,i.e., manipulating PDF file with canvas.
### Note:
**Once you move on to the next page. The redaction is set on the page.**
**The larger the resolution of the screen, the better quality of the file maintains.**
The result is almost the same as the [Angular7PDF_Redactor](https://github.com/ldu2/PDFRedactor/tree/master/Angular7PDF_Redactor)
## Documentation
So far, it's not well documented but it does what it intended to do.
The code will be better documented in the future.
